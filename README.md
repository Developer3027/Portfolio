# Developer 3027 Portfolio
This is the repo for my portfolio. The initial project is on the repo called A. Once that project was built I decided to work features and bug fixes in more of a agile ecosystem. This is to learn and show my knowledge about working in a team environment. My knowledge of SCRUM development and sprint cycles.

For project management I am using Click Up which is an all in one platform. I can create docs or link to resources. I have it set to work in a agile work flow with scrum. To review this please ask to be added at dev3027@mason-roberts.com.

For communication I am using Slack which includes a slack channel dedicated to this build. As cards are moved or commented on in Click Up, the Slack channel is updated.

For code I am using Github. This allows me to have feature branches and a production branch. My production branch for this project is the main branch.

For CI / CD I am using the above and Netlify. Netlify is using this repo and builds the main branch when a change is made. So as changes are merged of pushed to the main branch, Netlify will perform a build and present it.

# Click Up
Click Up has been integrated in this repo. Click Up is being used for project management. I am using a standard Agile, scrum work flow. This is worked in standard sprints of 2 weeks.

To change the status of a task on Click Up, include the task id when you commit your change. You can get the id from the card. Hover over the card, click the three dots in the lower right to bring up the menu. Click the hash tag icon in the header to copy the card id. Format like: cu-1234[status].

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
